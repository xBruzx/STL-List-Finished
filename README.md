# STL List CSC 1310

A program to illustrate working with Lists in C++ 

## Description

A program that was partially made by the instructor of my class, and code I added on to make it work as an assignment of CSC 1310 at TTU. The program reads in characters from a text file and adds them to a list and the player will have the option to scroll through the list and look at the characters, add their own, and even will be able to delete characters from the list.
